## Sleep summary

From a source file `$DATASET.cwa`, you can produce a sleep analysis file `$DATASET.sleep.csv` with the OMGUI tool.

You must produce a text file `$DATASET.sleep.times.csv` which contains the intervals of sleep, and this file must be in a particular format (described below).  An easy way to produce this file is to use the *Excel* template `_TEMPLATE.sleep.times.xltx` file by copying in the sleep diary data in the first sheet (`Sheet1`), and exporting the second sheet (`csv`) as `.CSV` file format and ensuring the file has the extensions ".sleep.times.csv".

Finally, drag the `$DATASET.sleep.csv` over the `omsummary-sleep.cmd` command script.  This will run `omsummary.exe` with the required parameters, and will generate the output file `$DATASET.sleep.summary.csv`.  This file (which can be opened in *Excel*), contains the headings:

	Label,Start,End,TimeInBed,SleepTime,SleepOnsetLatency,WakeTime,TimeToGetUp,WakeAfterSleepOnset,Awakenings,TotalSleepTime,SleepEfficiency

Where the times are all in minutes, and the columns are:

* Label: The label from the input `.times` file. 
* Start: The start time from the input `.times` file. 
* End: The end time from the input `.times` file. 
* TimeInBed: The *end*-*start* interval from the input `.times` file. 
* SleepTime: The actual start time of the first sleep period within the interval. 
* SleepOnsetLatency: The time after the start of the interval until the first sleep period within the interval. 
* WakeTime: The actual end time of the last sleep period within the interval. 
* TimeToGetUp: The time after the last sleep period within the interval, until the end of the interval. 
* WakeAfterSleepOnset: The elapsed time between the start time of the first sleep period, and the end time of the last sleep period, within the interval. 
* Awakenings: The number of sleep periods within the interval, minus one. 
* TotalSleepTime: The accumulated total of all of the sleep periods within the interval. 
* SleepEfficiency: The percentage of the total time in bed accounted as part of the total sleep time. 


### Detail: Transforming sleep diary times using Excel

This section describes the transformation from a sleep diary to the `sleep.times.csv` file that the summary tool requires.  This is how the template `_TEMPLATE.sleep.times.xltx` file is configured.  

Where the source format in `Sheet1` tab is:

	{date.day}/{date.month}/{date.year},{report.hour}:{report.min},*,*,{lof.hour},{lof.min},{lon.hour},{lon.min}

The sheet `csv` contains three columns, the first row:

	Start,End,Label

...and the second row the formulae

	Start	=Sheet1!$A2+IF(Sheet1!$E2*60+Sheet1!$F2>Sheet1!$G2*60+Sheet1!$H2,-1,0)+((Sheet1!$E2+(Sheet1!$F2/60))/24)
	End 	=Sheet1!$A2+((Sheet1!$G2+(Sheet1!$H2/60))/24)
	Label	=Sheet1!$A2+Sheet1!$B2

Which are then copied downwards.

Where the Start/End columns are formatted with:

	Format/number/custom/type: yyyy-mm-dd hh:mm:ss

...and the Label column is formatted with:

	Format/number/custom/type: yyyy-mm-dd


### Detail: .sleep.times.csv file format

The file is a text file, and may contain a first line (row) describing the columns (the line may be omitted if the order is unchanged, as this is the default):

	Start,End,Label

...and subsequent lines (rows) where date/times are formatted with the international standard `YYYY-MM-DD hh:mm:ss`, for example (where the label is the date):

	2015-12-04 23:40:00,2015-12-05 11:15:00,2015-12-05
